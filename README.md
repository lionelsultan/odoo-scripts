# Odoo Notes and Comments Exporter

This repository provides a Python script to **export notes and internal comments** from an **Odoo Cloud (SaaS)** instance.  
The extracted data is saved into a **CSV file**, encoded in **UTF-8 with BOM**, using a **custom column separator** (`Â£`).

This ensures maximum compatibility with spreadsheet software like **Microsoft Excel**, **LibreOffice**, and **Google Sheets**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Connects to **Odoo Cloud** via **XML-RPC API**.
- Automatically **checks** if the `note.note` model (personal notes) exists.
- **Exports** both:
  - Personal Notes (`note.note`) (if available),
  - Internal Comments from the **Chatter** (`mail.message`) (always available).
- Generates a **CSV** file with:
  - UTF-8 BOM encoding,
  - Custom delimiter `Â£`,
  - Minimal quoting (only when necessary).
- Cleans up text fields by removing line breaks (`\n`, `\r`) for better CSV readability.
- Adds metadata columns: source, linked model, linked object ID, author, date, content.
